The AotC Rework is awesome, don't get me wrong, but I prefer the look of the old one WAY more. That as well as a few other things I'd change/add, caused me to make this mod.
Scales in power depending on whether you have calamity installed (or it would if i had programmed that in yet)

Also adds more random items that I just feel like making, maybe this will turn into a hybrid QoL Content mod who knows

please send bug reports or suggestions n stuff to aotc2669 on discord ok yes thanks
