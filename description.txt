The AotC Rework is awesome, don't get me wrong, but I prefer the look of the old one WAY more. Combine that with a few other things I'd change/add, I decided to make this mod.
If you have Calamity installed, it's craftable with shadowspec bars and the most cursed recipe you will ever see.

please send bug reports or suggestions n stuff to aotc2669 on discord ok yes thanks
