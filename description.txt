The AotC rework is awesome, don't get me wrong, but I prefer the look of the old one WAY more. That as well as a few other things I'd change/add, caused me to make this mod.

You can get the old ark by throwing the new one into shimmer.

Also adds more random items that I just feel like making, maybe this will turn into a hybrid QoL/Content mod who knows
