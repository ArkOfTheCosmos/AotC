The AotC Rework is awesome, don't get me wrong, but I prefer the look of the old one WAY more. That as well as a few other things I'd change/add, caused me to make this mod.
Scales in power depending on whether you have Calamity installed 
You can get the old ark by throwing the new one into shimmer.

Also adds more random items that I just feel like making, maybe this will turn into a hybrid QoL/Content mod who knows

please send bug reports or suggestions n stuff to aotc2669 on discord ok yes thanks
